# VineAtOnce
Website to play all the vines of a selected user at once.

# Warning! #
Due to the nature of this application, (in its current release) it is extremely resource heavy and will eat up memory and bandwidth. It is also likely to crash the chrome tab it is running in. To edit the amount of videos displayed per users, open the "vao.ejs" file, go to line 29 and change the righthand sign integer. This will limit the amount of requests the page is allowed to send to the Vine API.
