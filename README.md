# ~~VineAtOnce~~
~~Website to play all the vines of a selected user at once.~~

# ~~Warning!~~ 
~~Due to the nature of this application, (in its current release) it is extremely resource heavy and will eat up memory and bandwidth. It is also likely to crash the chrome tab it is running in. To edit the amount of videos displayed per user, open the "vao.ejs" file, go to line 29 and change the righthand side integer. This will limit the amount of requests the page is allowed to send to the Vine API.~~

## The Vine API calls used in this repo (requests to https://api.vineapp.com/) are no longer successful due to the termination of the API and the termination of Vine
